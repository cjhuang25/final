                As digitization increases and people are relying more on online platforms, the presence of
                traditional books and delivery means to become less common. But sometimes I wonder if it's possible
                to combine digitalization and traditional platforms together so as to access the benefits of both.
                For example, the QR code can be used creatively and for easy access, while keeping traditional
                printing as it offers an unparallelled experience for people who cherish the experience of reading
                on papers.

                The article discussed the concept of “hypermodernism” and mentioned that the next cultural movement will
                be hyperlinked signs. This is an epitome of the intersection of design and technology. Hyperlinking
                information and compressing external sources into a simple text provides convenience for the user and
                allows for more user friendly features in design. It's interesting to see the transformations of design
                and how technology plays a part in it.

                The article introduces the concept of Gestalt, which is a familiar concept for me because I learned it

                incorporates human instincts and reactions. A lot of logo designs encompass illusions such as vase face
                to grab audience's attention. The human eye is instantly attracted to visual illusions approaches.

                The author of the reading pointed out the real functionality of a website and how it differentiates
                from
                other online platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. A website can be transformed into all sorts
                of
                creative processes -- from representing a garden to behaving like a puddle, the website can truly
                become
                anything we want it to be. A website can have "endless possibilities," and we can explore them by
                mixing
                personal meanings and and intentionally interrelating the cultural imprints that we have. It's very
                interesting to see this breath of fresh idea -- websites can become a form of self-expression.

                In the reading, Carrión provides a juxtaposition of new art and old art. Something that stood out to me
                is "Plagiarism is the starting point of the creative activity in the new art." In society, the general
                consensus is that plagiarism is not beneficial to learning and prohibits creativity from individuals.
                Therefore, in many settings such as classrooms, plagiarism is prohibited and abstained from. What's
                interesting is that, the writer of this reading suggests that innovation sometimes derives from some
                sort of plagiarism -- inspiration from others' work. It also made me think that institutional and
                societal standards can sometimes prohibit inventions.

                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>

                This reading discusses the concept of software and its relationship with transparency and visibility.
                The author argues that the conflation of information with transparency is at odds with the actual
                operations of computation, which require the use of glass to send and receive light pulses to re-create
                the referent. The current emphasis on transparency in product design and political and scholarly
                discourse is a compensatory gesture. Software perpetuates certain notions of seeing as knowing, of
                reading and readability, by mimicking both ideology and ideology critique, creating an invisible system
                of visibility. From this reading, I learned that it's imperative to engage media with software
                critically, examining the limitations of transcoding.

                This reading made me rethink the role of advertisements and design play into our daily lives. As the
                reading suggests, advertisements can oftentimes turn cultures into markets and create barriers between
                city centers and villages. The packaged cities may also lose its raw and genuine form because of the
                manufacturing process that advertisements create. This makes me wonder how we can draw a fine line to
                keep the originality and innovation while designing.

                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>

                This piece of reading describes the use of al text and its importance in many fields, especially arts.
                People who can't see or have limited visions are often prevented from accessing and enjoying artworks;
                however, al text, a description of the image embedded in the code, helps people visualize the image.
                When writing al-texts, the writer should also keep in mind that the writing could contain subjectivity
                and personal interpretation. It's difficult to describe images, especially artworks, without adding in
                an element of your own opinion, but we should stay away from doing that as much as possible.

                This reading provides insights into making design and the creative world more inclusive, which is
                largely influenced by the accessibility of languages imbedded in the programs. I can personally relate
                to the content of this reading: as a bilingual myself, I oftentimes appreciate the options of using
                different languages while using applications. Language accessibility is a crucial part of the user
                experience, and it's important as designers to recognize that and try to incorporate as many accessible
                functions as possible.

                This reading is not only entertaining with the interesting storyline of Gem ending up stuck inside the
                computer, but it is also educational through offering the history of technology. For example, the
                excerpt details that the creation of internet made social change more possible, and that in the 1990s,
                "the internet inspired the creation of Afronet, which aimed to help Black people find each other
                online."

                I also love the illustrations in this reading -- they offer so much depth to the story and making
                reading more engaging. Overall, I think that this story is able to educate and engage readers in a fun
                way.

                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>

                The reading summarizes the concept of feed and social network and the rationale behind people's
                addiction to them. I can personally very much relate to it because I'm oftentimes trapped in the endless
                concept of feed/social media. Once I start scrolling on TikTok, for example, I anticipate more and this
                leads me down into the rabbit role. As well, the feature of feed builds a "collective subjectivity" that
                involves people surrounding you, including family, friends, and even strangers. The ability to share the
                content we consume with others furthers the endlessness.
